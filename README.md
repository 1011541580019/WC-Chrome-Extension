### :thinking: What are Chrome Extensions? 

*Extensions are software programs that customize the browsing experience. They enable users to tailor Chrome functionality and behavior to individual needs or preferences. They are built on web technologies such as HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.*
Curate the web by:
- *Extending, exploring, and discovering the vast Chrome functionality possibilities.*
- *Providing accessibility to users with unique needs.*
- *Stretching a website's features with a companion extension.*
- *Styling Chrome with a new theme.*
- *Migrating a Chrome OS app to an extension for other platform users.*

*Make the web accessible, customizable, and even more awesome.*

### :bulb: What is WC-Chrome Extension? 
###### WC stands for ***Word Counter***. 
- This an  extension which I though would be useful for me while preparing for my language proficiency test where in we have to keep track of number of words used.
- It is quite common in various applications that we have to fill in say x number of words and in many cases there's no word counting software not available on such applications. So I decided to make an extension where in I could paste my text and know the no.of words.
